# Biotopia
Biotopia is a wiki a place where users can share and expand knowledge on environmental art.

Biotopia may partake in an upcoming festival at the end of May and needs assistance interfacing with the public and capturing users/content developers. The wiki model seems like the right place for this project to take shape, but the ironic barrier is wiki-markup. 

Wikitext is easy for people used to working in a coded environment but it is not user friendly to the uniducted. Even with the wiki widget, it is still a bit cumbersome as it is not exactly intuitive. Uploading a picture is complicated for those with no experience.  

Ideas on how to make this project a more user friendly experience are greatly appreciated. The current interface discouraging those without the framework for wikitext from participating. Is there a tool we can make to make participating in thei project easier without having to learn wikicode first?
