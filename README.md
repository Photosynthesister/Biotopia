# Biotopia
Better tool than wiki-widget (or wikitext) needed for novice content developers on a wiki.

Biotopia is a wiki a place where users can share and expand knowledge on environmental art.

Biotopia may partake in an upcoming festival at the end of May and needs assistance interfacing with the public and capturing users/content developers. The wiki model seems like the right place for this project to take shape, but the ironic barrier is wiki-markup. 

Wikitext is easy for people familiar with working in a coded environment but it is not user friendly to the uninducted. Even with the wiki widget, it is still a bit cumbersome as it is not exactly intuitive. Uploading a picture is complicated for those with no experience.  

Ideas on how to make this project a more user friendly experience are greatly appreciated. The current interface discourages those without the framework for wikitext from participating. Is there a tool we can make to make participating in this project easier without having to learn wikicode first?

I use wiki wiki to host this site where I am the account administrator. Users first  "request an account". Then the request is sent to me for approval. After approval, users login to the site to write content. What might be amazing is if users could go to my artist website, write their articles there and have the option to save or upload their articles directly into the wiki. I can obvioulsy embed the wiki into my site, but I would rather embed a tool that allows users to populate the content of the wiki more easily. I want it to be as smooth as possible for people to partcipate. 

Or it would super cool if there was an app for google chrome where people could fillout a template on google doc, then simply submit their content.
